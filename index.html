        <p class="tagline">Your caring companion through pregnancy and new motherhood</p>
        <p class="description">
          Pregnancy and early motherhood can feel joyful, overwhelming, beautiful, and
          exhausting. Sometimes all at once. You don't have to go through it all on your own.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Kozani is a friendly AI companion designed to support your mental and emotional
          well-being during pregnancy and the early months of motherhood, especially if you
          don't always have easy access to support. Kozani is here to listen, encourage you,
          and share simple, trustworthy information when you need it, without judgment.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Think of Kozani as someone you can check in with at any time, whether you're
          feeling anxious, low, unsure, or just need a moment to breathe and talk things
          through. It's a safe space to talk about what you're feeling.
        </p>

        <p class="tagline">What Kozani isn't</p>
        <p class="description">
          Kozani isn't a doctor or therapist and doesn't replace professional care. But it can
          help you feel heard and guide you towards extra support if you need it.
        </p>

        <p class="tagline">Your privacy matters</p>
        <p class="description">
          Your conversations are treated with care and respect and won't be shared without
          your permission. This is your safe space to speak honestly.
        </p>

        <p class="tagline">Speaking your language</p>
        <p class="description">Speaking your language
          Kozani can chat in several South African languages and is still learning, so thank you
          for your patience as it grows. We're working hard to help Kozani become more fluent
          in African languages. If something doesn't sound quite right, you're welcome to
          correct it or share feedback. That helps Kozani learn and serve moms better.
        </p>
        
        <p class="tagline">If you need urgent support</p>
        <p class="description">If you ever feel unsafe, extremely overwhelmed, or have thoughts of harming
        yourself or your baby, please reach out for real-world support. In South Africa, you
        can contact The Parent Centre on 021 762 0116 for confidential help.
        </p>

        <p class="description">You deserve care, compassion, and support, especially during this season of your
        life.
